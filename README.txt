This set of Python Scripts are designed to help with transferring data from large excel spreadsheets when people donâ€™t format things correctly (i.e. putting more than one piece of data into a cell). Also. EXCEL IS NOT A DATABASE, SO STOP USING IT AS ONE. The main purpose of this program is for when users treat spreadsheets like databases. Have too much data in a spreadsheet? use regex. Excel? No regex. Please, use databases for this kind of thing.

===Supported File formats===
.xlsx
.xls
============================

Your Excel file must be the same as the file name on line 4 of ToCSV.py

run ToCSV first, select the spreadsheet file that you want to use, and name the output file, then open that output file in a text editor. All you have to do is add spaces where you want commas to be. Then run AddCommas.py

A comma denotes a cell. lines denote rows. 
The data is essentially just a raw spreadsheet
2,4,6,8
1,2,3,4
10,13,0,3 
will open like this is a spreadsheet
--------------
|2|4|6|8
--------------
|1|2|3|4
--------------
|10|13|0|3
--------------

if you did this 

2,4,6,8
1,2,3,4
1,0,1,3,0,3

in the file that comes out after you run ToCSV, the spreadsheet would look like

--------------
|2|4|6|8
--------------
|1|2|3|4
--------------
|1|0|1|3|0|3
--------------

The 10 is separated into 1,0 Which is parsed by the spreadsheet as two separate cells, containing 1 and 0 respectively.
